Sarumawashi
===========

_Sarumawashi_ is a C++ library which manipulates 3x3x3 cube puzzles 
(Rubik's cube). This repository includes the library and some sample codes 
using it. _Sarumawashi_ is a Japanese word which means Japanse 
traditional streat performings by monkeys.

How to use it
-------------

Since there has been no documentations yet, see the sample codes.
To run the sample code, just type these:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kotarot/Sarumawashi.git
cd Sarumawashi
make
./sample/sample
```

Future works
------------

I will implement the following contents if I have time.

- Infinite moneky cubes (applying _infinite monkey theorem_ to the cube 
puzzle).
- Some metaheuristic algorithms to solve the cube puzzle.
